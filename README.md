Front-End:<br/>
Create a React web application that allows users to search for movies by title and displays the results in a grid. The application should have the following features:
1.	A search bar that allows users to search for movies by title.
2.	A grid that displays movie posters and titles.
3.	Clicking on a movie poster should show additional information about the movie, such as the plot, the cast, and the release date.
4.	The user should be able to sort the search results based on relevance, rating, or release date.

Back-End:<br/>
Create a .NET Core API that retrieves movie data from the OMDB API (http://www.omdbapi.com). The API should have the following endpoints:
1.	/api/movies/search?query=&lt;searchTerm&gt;: Returns a list of movies that match the search term.
2.	/api/movies/&lt;imdbId&gt;: Returns additional information about a specific movie, such as the plot, the cast, and the release date.
<br/>
The front-end should make API calls to the back-end to retrieve the movie data.<br/>
